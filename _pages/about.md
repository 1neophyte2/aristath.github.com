I've been building websites since the 90s and coding in WordPress since 2006. Yes, you could call me an old fart and I won't be offended, I built my first site before CSS was invented.

Passionate about Web Sustainability & Web Accessibility.

I work full-time at [ThemeFusion](https://theme-fusion.com/) where I help build the Avada theme.  
Author of many open-source projects and frameworks, most notably the [Kirki Customizer Framework](https://w.org/plugins/kirki) and the [Gridd WordPress Theme](https://w.org/themes/gridd). Older projects include the Shoestrap Theme, the Maera framework and others. On my free time (if you can call it that) I work on my open-source projects and attending the [Deque University](https://dequeuniversity.com/) to get my degree on Web Accessibility in an official capacity.  

<br>
Born in 1981 in Greece - where I still live, my extra skills include crochet, wood carving, building guitar pedals and dabling with arduinos. Back in the day I studied sound engineering and I can play the guitar & bass. I used to play the clarinet and trumpet but it's been more than 20 years so don't expect a tune.

If you're oldfashioned you can [send me an email](mailto:aristath@gmail.com) though I can't guarantee a prompt response, it's a mess and things tend to get lost there.
