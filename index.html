<h4>I love Open-Source and try to release most -if not all- of my projects under the GPL so that everyone can beefit from my work.</h4>

<p>For the past decade I've been building websites for small and large companies. I specialize in responsive front-end design, HTML/CSS and web interfaces. Some of my most popular pojects include the <a href="http://shoestrap.org/downloads/elusive-icons-webfont/">Elusive Icons Webfont</a> and the <a href="http://shoestrap.org">Shoestrap</a> WordPress theme.</p>
<p>Currently I work at WPMU-DEV as support staff and my startup <a href="http://wpmu.io">wpmu.io</a>, striving to evolve and improve my personal projects.</p>
