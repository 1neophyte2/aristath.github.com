With this article I'll be sharing some more info about myself and launch this blog.

I've been working with with WordPress for 5 years. Back then WordPress was ugly and pretty limited as to what it could do. It was not the framework that it has now become, and it surely did not have all the great developers it now has.

Though I loved WordPres, it wasn't as powerful as it is now. So for relatively big projects I preferred using **Drupal** instead.
Drupal is a powerful tool and will always have a special place in my heart. I believe WordPress can really benefit and take some valuable lessons from it. Especially the way it handles queries and its themeing layer.

However in the past 2-3 years, WordPress has really evolved and has started being more of a framework-CMS than a simple blog engine. So I am now using it exclusively for all my projects, no matter how small or large. Occasionally I use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for some projects that don't really need to be dynamic (like for example this blog).

The people that influenced me the most are [Pippin](http://pippinsplugins.com/) and [Otto](http://ottopress.com/).
I owe both of them a great deal since their tutorials really helped me understand a lot of things.
I would recommend anyone starting out with WordPress to bookmark their sites and follow them.

After so many years though, I now actually have some useful things I can share so in this blog I will be sharing things that I discover and techniques that have helped me evolve and become a better developer.
Small -or big- things that can really make a difference!
