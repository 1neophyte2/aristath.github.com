Every now and then I stumble upon an article about Women in WordPress, Women in Drupal or Women in another community.  
Every time, I read the same things: _"There are not enough women in community X"_, _"Where are the women in X?"_, and so on.  
Then, every single article I read goes on to say how we can empower women to do more:

* If you're the head of a company, make sure you hire more women. The goal is to have as many women as men.
* More women should be speaking at WordCamps or other similar events.
* Other things that I can't remember right now.

Every single time, a little voice inside me asks and screams _"why??"_

Who cares if the speaker at an event is male or female?  
Who cares if an employee is a man or a woman?  
Who cares if there are X male developers and Y female developers in project Z?  

What difference does it make??
Will my attention to a presentation vary depending on the presenter's gender? - **NO.**  
Will having the same number of female employees as male employees make company A better than company B? - **NO.**  
Does it matter that I'm a man and some of you are women? - **Why would it?**  

We all breath the same air, want the same things and deal with the same kind of difficulties day in day out.

If you're organizing an event and you're the one approving or rejecting candidates, then ignore the name for a while and focus on the content of the presentation. It doesn't matter if the presenter is male, female, a color unlike yours or from a country you've never heard of. If they're good, then that's all that matters.  
Similarly if you're responsible for hiring people at a company, for god's sake stop trying to make the numbers even! If you get an applicant, then just judge them for their skills and what they are, not _who_ they are.  

**Equality means using the same standards for everyone.  
Everyone should have the same opportunities.**  
It does not, under any circumstances mean that the number of speakers/employees should be equally divided.  

Why am I writing all of the above? Simply because I recently read yet another blog post - forgive me but I don't recall where, it just made an impression to me - where the female author was basically saying
> I made a fuss about it and got chosen to speak on event X instead of Mr. Something. Yay!! Now the women/men ratio is 60-40%.

That's perfectly fine... but on that blog post the author explained that she was fighting for women's rights in community X, because there are too many men and not enough women there and that is not fair. So, she contacted the organizers complaining that they are sexists since the number of male speakers was by far greater than that of female speakers.  
If she was right, then I can understand her frustration. But I seriously, seriously doubt that.  
Judging from her overall tone in that blog post I got the impression the reason she was initially rejected was because she was simply not worth it.  
If you were the event organizer in that case, what would you do?  
Would you risk having someone accuse you of being sexist/racist (they are the same to me)? Or would you do some cooking - which I suspect is what happened in that case - to make sure that doesn't happen?  
Should we really care about the numbers?

IMHO we should not care at all about ... We should just completely ignore gender when it comes to things like that.  
If you want something then do your best to get it with your talents and your skills. Don't invoke things like gender, race or whatever.  

We're all people of the same world, and as an old song says
>we all live under the same sun  
We all walk under the same moon  
Then why, why can't we live as one?
