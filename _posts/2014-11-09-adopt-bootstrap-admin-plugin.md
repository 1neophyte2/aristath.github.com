A few years ago I created a free WordPress plugin that was adding the necessary CSS & JS to the WordPress dashboard to make it cleaner. It was a pretty simple plugin... and it knew great success!
So far it has been downloaded more than 23000 times from the [WordPress Repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bootstrap-admin/) and is by far the most successful admin-theme available.

However, it no longer works. As of WordPress 3.8 this plugin is not functional and could use a complete rewrite.  
Unfortunately I am not able to do so myself because I am working on other projects and also have a full-time job so time is a luxury I cannot afford.

It's a shame to see such a plugin go to waste, so I have decided to put it up for adoption.

In my mind I envisioned creating a WordPress administration interface that would look something like this: [http://rubix.sketchpixy.com/ltr](http://rubix.sketchpixy.com/ltr) (click on the "[view demo](http://rubix.sketchpixy.com/ltr#/app/dashboard)"" link on the top right") but that's kinda complicated and knowing myself I would not be able to compromise with anything less than that.

Since I am unable to work on this project at this time, I have decided that it's perhaps best if someone else takes it and gives it the love it needs.  
However if you're thinking of taking over this plugin there are some things you should know.

* Right now its code is rubbish. Seriously... it was one of my first plugins ever, and it's poorly written. It needs a **complete** rewrite.
* You should not have in mind of anything like a "premium" version. I created this plugin because I wanted to build something useful and cool, not to make money. It should remain that way.

Still interested?
